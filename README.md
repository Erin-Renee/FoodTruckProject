### Project Name
Food Trucks
### Overview
For the food trucks application, I created an application with an abstract
class and a class with a main method. The FoodTrucksApp would display a menu, and then call the methods based on what was selected. The application would start by prompting the user to input food trucks which included the name, food type, and rating. They also had the option to quit and move on to the next menu which would then give the user an option to display the list of trucks,  the highest rating,, the average rating, or  print out "goodbye", and quit the program.

### Concepts/ topics Covered

Array
@override
toString
switch
boolean

### Technology Used
Atom
Eclipse
Github

### Lessons Learned
The main() kicked off run() which didn't do anything. I fixed my menu to correctly call my methods I had based on what the user selected.
